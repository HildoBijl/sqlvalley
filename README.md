## Features

The SQL Valley web app is an innovative educational site - no installation required! - featuring:

- A SQL tutorial structured into dozens of small bite-sized modules.
- An interactive Skill Tree showing the hierarchy between modules and tracking your progress through them.
- Freedom to jump forwards and backwards, ensuring efficient learning.
- Theory conveyed through example-rich explanations, visual summaries and short instructional videos - adapted to the user's preferences.
- Interactive SQL exercises through a live in-browser database using realistic mock data.
- Automated feedback on exercise submissions with enhanced error detection.
- Didactic solutions for every exercise, connected to the theory explanations.
- A gamification layer (optional): solve a mystery and experience the story as you progress through the content!
- Privacy ensured: all user data is stored locally on the device. No identifiable data is sent anywhere.


## Running SQL Valley locally

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed.

```
git clone https://github.com/HildoBijl/sqlvalley.git
cd sqlvalley
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will open a new browser tab at http://localhost:3000/ showing the site locally.


## The tech stack

The app runs fully client-side, using an in-browser SQLite database. We use the following technology to make this happen.

- [Vite](https://vite.dev/) for development and bundling.
- [React](https://react.dev/) for front-end rendering.
- [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/) for layout and styling.
- [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/) for our SQL input fields.
- [SQL.JS](https://sql.js.org/) to run [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/) as in-browser database.
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for hosting.
- [Zustand](https://zustand.docs.pmnd.rs/learn/getting-started/introduction) and localStorage to track your progress.

All other parts, like the Skill Tree tool, the mock database and the storyline, are developed in-house.
