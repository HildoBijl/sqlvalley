		solution: <>
			<Par>The employee's first and last name come from the <IDL>employee</IDL> predicate, while the <IDL>contract</IDL> predicate lists the positions they held. We hence have to join those predicates through the employee ID.</Par>
			<DL>employeePosition(fn, ln, pos) :- employee(id, fn, ln, _, _, _, _, _, _), contract(id, pos, _, _, _, _, _).</DL>
		</>,

	{
		problem: <Par>Find, for every department (its name) with less than 20 employees, in which city the manager is living in.</Par>,
		solution: <>
			<Par>We join the <IDL>department</IDL> predicate with the <IDL>employee</IDL> predicate by setting the manager ID equal to the employee ID. If we also add the respective condition, we wind up with the following rule.</Par>
			<DL>smallDepartmentManagerCity(n, c) :- department(_, n, mid, _, ne), employee(mid, _, _, _, _, _, c, _, _), ne &lt; 20.</DL>
			<Par>The order of the literals in the rule formally does not matter, although it is customary to first join (write all predicates) and then filter (add in the conditions).</Par>
		</>,
	},
	{
		problem: <Par>Find, for every employee (first and last name), the name of the department they are allocated to.</Par>,
		solution: <>
			<Par>We need a three-way join for this: we join <IDL>employee</IDL> to <IDL>allocation</IDL> and then again to <IDL>department</IDL>. It is customary to combine both joins into one rule.</Par>
			<DL>employeeDepartment(fn, ln, dn) :- employee(eid, fn, ln, _, _, _, _, _, _), allocation(eid, did), department(did, dn, _, _ , _).</DL>
			<Par>It is important to consciously choose variable names to make sure that equal variable names indeed ought to have equal values.</Par>
