      <Par>When tables are linked through a foreign key, we often have to look up values from one table based on a condition from the other table. On way to do so, is to first find a list of all the relevant IDs/keys from the second table, and then to use the <ISQL>IN</ISQL> keyword to find the matching rows from the first table.</Par>
      <Quote>Find the IDs and names of all the managers who manage a department with more than ten employees.</Quote>
      <FigureExampleQuery query={`SELECT e_id, first_name, last_name
FROM employees
WHERE e_id IN (
  SELECT manager_id
  FROM departments
  WHERE nr_employees > 10
);`} tableWidth={260} />
      <Par>Another option is to use the <ISQL>EXISTS</ISQL> keyword, which runs the inner query and checks if it returns any (non-zero) number of rows.</Par>
      <FigureExampleQuery query={`SELECT e_id, first_name, last_name
FROM employees
WHERE EXISTS (
  SELECT 1
  FROM departments
  WHERE employees.e_id = departments.manager_id
    AND nr_employees > 10
);`} tableWidth={260} />
      <Warning>This second example is a <Term>correlated query</Term>: the <Term>inner query</Term> uses a table from the <Term>outer query</Term>. In non-correlated queries, the inner query is run just once. In correlated queries, the inner query is run for <Em>every</Em> row of the outer query. This makes correlated queries relatively slow.</Warning>
      <Info>Inner queries may use any table from any outer query, but outer queries may <Em>never</Em> use any table from any inner query.</Info>
