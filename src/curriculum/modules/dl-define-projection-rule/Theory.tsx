      <Par>We know that <Term>projection</Term> comes down to selecting various columns from a table. How do we do so using Datalog?</Par>

    <Section title="Limit a predicate to specific variables">
      <Par>Suppose that we have a predicate (a table) containing all employees of a company. Let's say we only want the first name and last name from this predicate. How can this be achieved?</Par>
      <Par>The best way to do so, is by setting up a new predicate (like a view) that <Em>only</Em> has these arguments. This can be done in Datalog through</Par>
      <FigureExampleDLQuery query={<>employeeName(fn, ln) :- employee(id, fn, ln, p, e, a, c, hd, cs).</>} actualQuery="SELECT first_name, last_name FROM employees" tableWidth={200} />
      <Par>You could read this rule as:</Par>
      <Quote>The two values <IDL>(fn, ln)</IDL> are an employee name, if there is some set of values (id, fn, ln, p, e, a, c, hd, cs) that is known to be an employee.</Quote>
      <Par>Behind the scenes, what happens is the following.</Par>
      <List items={[
        <>As always, Datalog will find all possible combinations of all variables such that all literals hold true. In this case, that's the set of <IDL>(id, fn, ln, p, e, a, c, hd, cs)</IDL> for which the entry appears in the employee predicate (table).</>,
        <>Datalog assembles a new predicate (a view) called <IDL>employeeName</IDL> with only two arguments: <IDL>fn</IDL> and <IDL>ln</IDL>, which correspond to the second and third argument from <IDL>employee</IDL>.</>,
        <>The result is a new view with all <IDL>(fn, ln)</IDL> values, for which there are other values <IDL>(id, p, e, a, c, hd, cs)</IDL> such that the whole combination <IDL>(id, fn, ln, p, e, a, c, hd, cs)</IDL> is in the <IDL>employee</IDL> predicate.</>,
      ]} />
      <Par>We have effectively applied projection to the <IDL>employee</IDL> predicate.</Par>
      <Info>Datalog does not do duplicates. If there are multiple employees with the same first and last name, then they will only appear once in the <IDL>employeeName</IDL> predicate.</Info>
    </Section>

    <Section title="Use anonymous variables to simplify the rule">
      <Par>The above Datalog rule is a bit elaborate: we have defined names for lots of variables that are subsequently not used. This can be done easier.</Par>
      <Par>If we have variables that we don't use anywhere, we can replace them by the special underscore character <IDL>_</IDL>. By using this character, we effectively tell Datalog "We don't care what the value of this is, and we won't be using it anywhere." It turns the respective variable into an <Term>anonymous variable</Term>.</Par>
      <Par>Using this new symbol, we can rewrite the above query through</Par>
      <FigureExampleDLQuery query={<>employeeName(fn, ln) :- employee(_, fn, ln, _, _, _, _, _, _).</>} actualQuery="SELECT first_name, last_name FROM employees" tableWidth={200} />
      <Par>This query does the exact same thing as the previous one, but it's clearer and easier to set up.</Par>
      <Warning>Normally, if you use the same variable name twice in a single Datalog rule, you require the two corresponding values to be equal. The underscore <IDL>_</IDL> is exempt from this idea. You can apply it as much as you like, and every time it means "This can have any value. We don't care about what exact value it is."</Warning>
