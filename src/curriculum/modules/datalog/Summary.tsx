      <Par><Term>Datalog</Term> is a promising up-and-coming query language based in logic theory. In Datalog, tables are called <Term>predicates</Term>: they are lists of <Term>facts</Term> (rows) with a fixed number of (order-based) <Term>arguments</Term> (columns).</Par>
      <DatalogFacts data={data1} predicate="employee" />
      <Par>A typical Datalog program consists of a number of <Term>rules</Term> that define new predicates. You can see these rules as view definitions.</Par>
      <DL>
        highEarningEmployee(id, fn, ln, p, e, a, c, hd, cs) :- employee(id, fn, ln, p, e, a, c, hd, cs), cs &gt;= 200000.<br />
        highEarningEmployeeName(fn, ln) :- highEarningEmployee(id, fn, ln, p, e, a, c, hd, cs).
      </DL>
      <Par>In these rules, the left part (the <Term>head</Term>) describes a new predicate (like a view), while the right part (the <Term>body</Term>) contains a list of comma-separated <Term>literals</Term> (conditions) that must hold true. Datalog will try to find <Em>all</Em> possible combinations values for <Em>all</Em> given <Term>variables</Term> such that <Em>all</Em> literals hold true.</Par>
      <Par>A Datalog program is ended with a <Term>query</Term> (or potentially multiple) that requests data. At this point Datalog starts to do the work to find the requested data.</Par>
      <DL>?- highEarningEmployeeName(firstName, lastName).</DL>
      <Par>The output is usually given in list form, showing all combinations of variables for which the query literal (or literals) holds true. You could of course visualize this for yourself as a table once more.</Par>
      <DatalogOutput data={{ values: data3.values, columns: ['firstName', 'lastName'] }} />
