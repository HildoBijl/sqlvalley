			<Par>We need to take the <RelationName>works</RelationName> relation and filter it by <Em>salary</Em>. The easiest way to do so is through the "or" operator.</Par>
			<RA>σ<sub>salary &lt; 40000 ∨ salary &gt; 100000</sub>(works)</RA>
			<Par>Another option is to use the "not" operator and brackets.</Par>
			<RA>σ<sub>¬(salary ≥ 40000 ∧ salary ≤ 100000)</sub>(works)</RA>
			<Par>This gets all the work data of workers who fall outside of the described salary range.</Par>
