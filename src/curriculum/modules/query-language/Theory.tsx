      <Par>We know that a database can be seen as a collection of tables managed by a Database Management System (DBMS). How do we interact with this DBMS?</Par>
    </Section>

    <Section title="The idea behind a query language">
      <Par>Databases usually don't have a flashy interface with clear graphics, useful buttons and such. To interact with the database and make it do anything, we have to give the DBMS specific commands. Think of "Create a new table 'employees'", "Add a new record to the 'employees' table" or "Find the names of all employees earning more than two hundred thousand per year." Such commands are known as <Term>queries</Term>: structured commands to extract/adjust data.</Par>
      <FigureQueryExample />
      <Par>Sadly DBMSs do not understand English, or any spoken language for that matter. Spoken languages are far too ambiguous. Queries must therefore follow a very specific format. The exact format of how to set up queries and what can be put in them is known as the <Term>query language</Term>.</Par>
    </Section>

    <Section title="Examples of query languages">
      <Par>So what does a query look like? This depends on the query language. There is a large variety of query languages: every DBMS pretty much has its own query language. But to get a feeling of what queries may look like, we study a few examples.</Par>
      <Par>Suppose that we want to find all employees earning more than 200.000 annually. In the <Term>SQL</Term> query language (the query language used by the most common/popular databases) that would be done through</Par>
      <Par><pre><code>{`SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM employees
WHERE current_salary > 200000
`}</code></pre></Par>
      <Par>In <Term>Datalog</Term> (a more modern and up-and-coming query language) this would be done with</Par>
      <Par><pre><code>{`highEarners(fn, ln) :- employees(_, fn, ln, _, _, _, _, _, s), s > 200000.
?- highEarners(fn, ln).`}</code></pre></Par>
      <Par>In <Term>relational algebra</Term> (a more theoretical and mathematical query language) this is done using</Par>
      <Par><pre><code>highEarners â† âˆ<sub>first_name,last_name</sub>(Ïƒ<sub>current_salary &gt; 200000</sub>(employees))</code></pre></Par>
      <Par>Or in an object-database like <Link to="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</Link> the query looks like this.</Par>
      <Par><pre><code>{`db.employees.find(
  { current_salary: { $gt: 200000 } },
  { first_name: 1, last_name: 1, _id: 0 }
)`}</code></pre></Par>
      <Par>You see that there is a large variety of query languages.</Par>
    </Section>

    <Section title="Three branches of query languages">
      <Par>Query languages usually consist of three parts (sublanguages) that work mostly independently from one another.</Par>
      <List items={[
        <>The <Term>Data Definition Language</Term> (DDL) revolves around defining the structure of data: creating tables, adjusting tables, etcetera.</>,
        <>The <Term>Data Manipulation Language</Term> (DML) focuses on adjusting data: adding/updating/deleting records.</>,
        <>The <Term>Data Query Language</Term> (DQL) focuses on working with existing data without modifying it: find the right data in tables, and possibly combine data from multiple tables to gain new insights.</>,
      ]} />
      <Par>When learning a query language, you usually start with the DQL, move on to the DML and end with the DDL. But in theory, you can start with any part of the query language.</Par>
      <Info>Here at SQL Valley we obviously focus on the SQL query language. On top of this, we mainly focus on the DQL side.</Info>
