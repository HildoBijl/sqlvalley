      <Par>We know how to aggregate columns using SQL, and we know how to apply filters. It is of course also possible to do both together. However, there's an important distinction between applying a filter <Em>before</Em> and applying a filter <Em>after</Em> aggregation. Let's take a look at how it works.</Par>
    </Section>

    <Section title={<>Filter rows <Em>before</Em> aggregating using <ISQL>WHERE</ISQL></>}>
      <Par>Let's consider the financial performance of the company per quarter.</Par>
      <FigureSingleTable query={`SELECT * FROM quarterly_performance`} tableScale={0.8} tableWidth={800} />
      <Par>Suppose that we want to get the average revenue for the <Em>first half</Em> of each year (January through June). How would we do that?</Par>
      <Par>The key is to first add a <ISQL>WHERE</ISQL> clause to select the rows that we want, throwing out the ones that we don't.</Par>
      <FigureExampleQuery query={`
SELECT *
FROM quarterly_performance
WHERE quarter <= 2;`} tableScale={0.8} tableWidth={800} below />
      <Par>Then we apply aggregation to this new table in the usual way. SQL will group the rows, calculate aggregates, and generate the output.</Par>
      <FigureExampleQuery query={`
SELECT fiscal_year, AVG(revenue) AS average_revenue_q12
FROM quarterly_performance
WHERE quarter <= 2
GROUP BY fiscal_year;`} tableScale={0.8} tableWidth={220} />
      <Par>Note that <ISQL>GROUP BY</ISQL> is written <Em>after</Em> the <ISQL>WHERE</ISQL> clause. This is to signify that the grouping (and subsequently the aggregation) is done <Em>after</Em> running the <ISQL>WHERE</ISQL> clause.</Par>
    </Section>

    <Section title={<>Filter rows <Em>after</Em> aggregating using <ISQL>HAVING</ISQL></>}>
      <Par>Extending on the previous example, suppose that we only care about the years whose average revenue in quarters 1 and 2 exceeded five million. In this case, we want to apply a filter to the <Em>aggregated</Em> table. Specifically, we want to filter on the new column "average_revenue_q12".</Par>
      <Par>The overly long and inconvenient way to do so, would be through a <Term>subquery</Term>.</Par>
      <FigureExampleQuery query={`
SELECT *
FROM (
  SELECT fiscal_year, AVG(revenue) AS average_revenue_q12
  FROM quarterly_performance
  WHERE quarter <= 2
  GROUP BY fiscal_year
) 
WHERE average_revenue_q12 > 5000000;`} tableScale={0.8} tableWidth={220} />
      <Par>Note that we took our aggregated table and treated it as a new table. It works, but it's a bit cumbersome, and since this is a use-case that occurs often in practice, SQL has a cleaner solution. We add a <ISQL>HAVING</ISQL> clause <Em>after</Em> the <ISQL>GROUP BY</ISQL> clause to filter the resulting table.</Par>
      <FigureExampleQuery query={`
SELECT fiscal_year, AVG(revenue) AS average_revenue_q12
FROM quarterly_performance
WHERE quarter <= 2
GROUP BY fiscal_year
HAVING AVG(revenue) > 5000000;`} tableScale={0.8} tableWidth={220} />
      <Par>This does the exact same thing, and it looks a lot cleaner!</Par>

      <Par>The <ISQL>HAVING</ISQL> clause works the same as the <ISQL>WHERE</ISQL> clause: you can set up any filter you like. However, keep in mind that the <ISQL>HAVING</ISQL> clause operates on the <Em>aggregated</Em> table. Just as within <ISQL>SELECT</ISQL>, you may only use <Em>grouping columns</Em> and <Em>results of aggregation functions</Em>. Using the columns from the original table here will make no sense, and usually results in an error.</Par>
      <Warning>
        <Par sx={{ mb: 1 }}>You may be wondering why we wrote <ISQL>{`HAVING AVG(revenue) > 5000000`}</ISQL> rather than <ISQL>{`HAVING average_revenue_q12 > 5000000`}</ISQL>. The latter would be clearer!</Par>
        <Par sx={{ mb: 1 }}>The problem here is the evaluation order that SQL uses. The <ISQL>SELECT</ISQL> clause (and with that the creation of the "average_revenue_q12" alias) is only run <Em>after</Em> the <ISQL>HAVING</ISQL> clause. So at the <ISQL>HAVING</ISQL> clause, the name "average_revenue_q12" does not exist yet! Most DBMSs will throw an error if you try to use an alias in your <ISQL>HAVING</ISQL> clause. Some DBMSs, like SQLite, do allow it through a work-around, but it's still not recommended.</Par>
        <Par>The solution is to write the same calculation again. It's a bit double, but it works. If we <Em>really</Em> don't want to repeat our calculations, we can use a subquery after all.</Par>
      </Warning>
    </Section>

    <Section title="Process numeric values before/after aggregation">
      <Par>Aggregation often goes hand with the further processing of column values. This can be done both before and after aggregation.</Par>
      <Par>First let's check out processing <Em>before</Em> aggregation. Suppose that we want to find the average budget per employee for all departments. To do so, we first calculate the budget per employee for each department, and subsequently find their average.</Par>
      <FigureExampleQuery query={`
SELECT AVG(budget / nr_employees) AS average_budget_per_employee_ratio
FROM departments;`} tableScale={0.8} tableWidth={220} />
      <Par>Using basic arithmetics like this is just one example of processing before aggregation. We can also use <ISQL>COALESCE</ISQL> to set up a fallback value in case of <ISQL>NULL</ISQL> values, or we can use <ISQL>CASE WHEN ... THEN ...</ISQL> to deal with even more edge cases.</Par>
      <Par>When we get results from aggregation, we can use these in our calculations too, effectively processing data <Em>after</Em> aggregation. Suppose that we want to get an overview of the cities where employees live. Using aggregation, we can count how many people live in each city. We could also calculate this as a percentage of the total employee count.</Par>
      <FigureExampleQuery query={`
SELECT
  city,
  COUNT(*) AS num_people,
  COUNT(*) * 100 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees) AS percentage
FROM employees
GROUP BY city;`} tableScale={0.8} tableWidth={320} />
      <Par>Note that we use <ISQL>COUNT</ISQL> and then start calculating with it, multiplying it by <ISQL>100</ISQL>. Also note that we have casually included a subquery within our calculations for the total number of employees. SQL allows subqueries wherever their value make sense. In this case, the subquery returns a single number, so SQL will treat the subquery as a number and use it in its calculations.</Par>
    </Section>

    <Section title="Use aggregation on text">
      <Par>Though not as common, it is possible to <Term>aggregate text</Term>. Most aggregation functions like <ISQL>SUM</ISQL> and <ISQL>AVG</ISQL> don't work for text, but a few are still relevant.</Par>
      <FigureExampleQuery query={`
SELECT
  MIN(d_name) AS first_in_alphabet,
  MAX(d_name) AS last_in_alphabet
FROM departments;`} tableScale={0.8} tableWidth={250} />
      <Par>One particular function that is useful in aggregating text is the <Term>string concatenation</Term> command. It concatenates all the values within a column, adding a separator in-between. It varies per DBMS what it's called: <ISQL>STRING_AGG</ISQL>, <ISQL>GROUP_CONCAT</ISQL>, or <ISQL>LISTAGG</ISQL>. We can for instance make a list of four-letter codes for each department and write them as a dash-separated list.</Par>
      <FigureExampleQuery query={`
SELECT GROUP_CONCAT(SUBSTRING(d_name, 1, 4), " - ") AS department_codes_list
FROM departments;`} tableScale={0.8} tableWidth={200} />
      <Par>Admittedly, it's not the most sensible use-case, but the idea is clear: a <Em>lot</Em> is possible with aggregation.</Par>
