      <Info>Recursive queries are often used to following successive links (so-called <Term>chains</Term>) between tables. Without recursive queries, you can only find chains of a <Em>fixed</Em> length. Recursive queries allow you to find chains of <Em>any</Em> length. This would be <Em>impossible</Em> without recursion, so any query language that supports recursion is inherently more powerful than a query language that does not.</Info>
      <Par>Recursive queries are evaluated using the <Term>fixed-point algorithm</Term>. This algorithm tracks a <Term>result set</Term> <M>R</M> and a <Term>delta set</Term> <M>\Delta</M>. Initially both are filled with the base case/anchor. Then the following <Term>iteration</Term> steps are repeated.</Par>
      <List items={[
        <><M>\Delta \leftarrow f(\Delta)</M>: use the previous delta set and the recursion definition <M>f</M> to try and find new cases.</>,
        <><M>\Delta \leftarrow \Delta - R</M>: track which of these cases have not been found before.</>,
        <><M>R \leftarrow R \cup \Delta</M>: add these new cases (if any) to the result set.</>,
      ]} />
      <Par>This is continued until the delta set <M>\Delta</M> ends up empty: no new cases can be found. The final result set <M>R</M> is then the output of the recursive query.</Par>
