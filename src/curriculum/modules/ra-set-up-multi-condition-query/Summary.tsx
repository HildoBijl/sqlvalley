      <Par>Whenever we have filtering requirements that span across two tables linked with a foreign key, we can use set operators to apply this filtering. There are four steps in this process.</Par>
      <List useNumbers items={[
        <>Find the keys from the first relation that match the first requirements.</>,
        <>Identically, find the keys from the second relation that match the second requirements.</>,
        <>If the keys have different attribute names, use the <Term>rename operator</Term> <M>{`\\rho_{A \\rightarrow B}(r)`}</M> to ensure both results have the same attribute names.</>,
        <>Use the right <Term>set operator</Term> to combine the two results. <List items={[
          <>Use the <Term>intersection</Term> <M>\cap</M> to get all tuples that occur in <Em>both</Em> relations.</>,

      <Par>Through this strategy, we could for instance find all department managers earning less than 200,000 per year.</Par>

      <Info>Whenever you use the set operators, it is common to do so only on keys (or combinations of keys) and not on full relations.</Info>
