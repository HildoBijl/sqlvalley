      <Par>We know that foreign keys can be used as references to other tables. We can use this to combine various tables into one big table. Let's take a look at how that works.</Par>
    </Section>

    <Section title="Join: use a foreign key to pull tables together">
      <Par>Let's consider two tables that are linked through a foreign key. For instance consider the tables for departments (with manager) and for employees.</Par>
      <FigureTwoTables />
      <Par>Let's say that we want a list of all departments <Em>including</Em> all attributes of the corresponding managers. In other words, we want all data in one big table. We could combine the two tables into one: we can <Term>join</Term> the tables.</Par>
      <Par>For the join to make sense, we must have one table (often placed on the left) with a foreign key to the other table (placed on the right). To execute the join, we walk through all the rows of the left table, and look up the respective record of the right table. We add this data to the back of the row. If we do this for all rows, we get the joined table. It has columns from both tables.</Par>
      <FigureSingleTable query={`SELECT * FROM departments d JOIN employees e ON d.manager_id=e.e_id;`} tableScale={0.6} tableWidth={1100} />
    </Section>

    <Section title="Decomposition: split a table into two through a foreign key">
      <Par>Note that in the joined table we found above, there could be duplicate data. If one manager manages two departments, then their contact data is mentioned multiple times! Storing such a table is not good database design. When we find a table like this, we should perform a decomposition. A <Term>decomposition</Term> is the opposite of a join: it splits a table up into two separate linked tables.</Par>
      <Par>When decomposing a table, we basically take three steps.</Par>
      <List useNumbers items={[
        <>Make a list of all the attributes that might potentially be repeated, and should be grouped into a separate table. For the example above, that's all employee properties, being <ISQL>{`{e_id, first_name, last_name, phone, email, address, city, hire_date, current_salary}`}</ISQL>.</>,
        <>Set up this new separate table. When doing so, ensure there are no duplicate rows, and define the table's primary key. For the example, we use <ISQL>e_id</ISQL> as primary key.</>,
        <>Remove all respective columns from the large table <Em>except</Em> the ones we put in the primary key. These are kept, to be used as foreign key. In the example, we use <ISQL>e_id</ISQL> as primary key and, for clarity, rename it as <ISQL>manager_id</ISQL>.</>,
      ]} />
      <Par>If we take these steps for the above example, we wind up with the two tables we started with. We effectively pulled out the right table, and the remains became the left table.</Par>
      <FigureTwoTables />
    </Section>

    <Section title="The formal definition: a Cartesian product and a filter">
      <Par>The formal definition of the join is <Em>not</Em> what is stated above. It is slightly more complex, and consists of two steps.</Par>
      <List useNumbers items={[
        <>
          <Par sx={{ mb: 1 }}>Find the <Term>Cartesian product</Term> of the two tables. This is the table with all possible combinations of one row from the left table and one row from the right table. This is a huge table, but we'll show it below anyway for our example data. Note that every combination of rows is present.</Par>
          <FigureSingleTable query={`SELECT * FROM departments, employees;`} tableScale={0.45} />
        </>,
        <>
          <Par sx={{ mb: 1 }}>Only keep the row combinations that are relevant, filtering out the rest. Here,  "relevant" means "having equal foreign key". So we only keep the rows where <ISQL>manager_id</ISQL> equals <ISQL>e_id</ISQL>. This completes the join.</Par>
          <FigureSingleTable query={`SELECT * FROM departments, employees WHERE manager_id=e_id;`} tableScale={0.45} />
        </>,
      ]} />
      <Info>The above definition of a join, through a Cartesian product, is a <Em>generalization</Em> of the idea we saw earlier. The look-up idea we saw earlier only works when the foreign key is unique in the second (for us <ISQL>employees</ISQL>) table. If this is not the case, for instance because multiple employees have the same employee ID, then the look-up fails. This generalized method with the Cartesian product always works.</Info>
    </Section>

    <Section title="The natural join: require equal-named columns to be equal">
      <Par>Whenever we do a join, we have to specify how this join is performed: which foreign key is used? In other words, which attributes are required to be equal?</Par>
      <Par>In practice, it often happens that the join is performed on attributes with the <Em>same name</Em>. When this is the case, we can apply a short-cut: the so-called natural join. A <Term>natural join</Term> is a join where we require all <Em>equally-named attributes</Em> to be equal. Effectively, we use the equally-named attributes as foreign key. This is a trick that at times can save us from having to specify on which attributes to join the tables.</Par>
      <Par>Let's show how this works with the example from before. Currently, when we join the tables, we have to specify that <ISQL>manager_id</ISQL> from one table has to equal <ISQL>e_id</ISQL> from the other table. But what if, within the <ISQL>departments</ISQL> table, the attribute was already called <ISQL>e_id</ISQL>? In that case, we could instantly perform a natural join. We wouldn't have to specify anymore how to perform the join, as it's implicit!</Par>
      <FigureNaturalJoin />
      <Warning>Using natural joins in practice is somewhat risky. If both tables wind up getting some other column with equal name (columns named "name", "date" or "quantity" are very common after all) then this attribute is automatically used in the join as well. The natural join requires this attribute to be equal too! Because of this easy oversight, natural joins are in practice discouraged.</Warning>
    </Section>

    <Section title="Outer joins: keep rows with missing references">
      <Par>Let's study the joining of departments and employees again. So far we've had a pretty ideal case: all departments had exactly one manager, and all employees managed at least one department. But what if that's not the case?</Par>
      <Par>To show how this works, first let's make our example data a bit messier. <List items={[
        <>We change the manager of Public Relations to a non-existing employee with ID <ISQL>{adjustedManagerId}</ISQL>.</>,
        <>We change the manager of Human Resources to Paris Casteel with ID <ISQL>{addedManagerId}</ISQL>. She now manages two departments.</>,
      ]} />
        Note that this leaves both Ceaser Bink and Marcelle Johnson without any department to manage.</Par>
      <FigureTwoTablesAdjusted />
      <Par>If we join the tables again, how do we deal with these missing links? There are actually four common ways to deal with this.</Par>
      <List items={[
        <>
          <Par>In the <Term>inner join</Term> (the default method) employees without a department or departments without an existing employee are ignored during the join. Since no valid matching is present, these entries disappear completely.</Par>
          <Par sx={{ my: 1 }}><FigureSingleTable query={`SELECT * FROM (${adjustedDepartments}) d INNER JOIN employees e ON d.manager_id=e.e_id;`} tableScale={0.6} tableWidth={1100} /></Par>
        </>,
        <>
          <Par>In the <Term>left (outer) join</Term> we <Em>always</Em> keep the rows from the left table (departments). If no matching row exists from the right table (employees) then we include <ISQL>NULL</ISQL> values to show something is missing. (But rows from the right table will still disappear on missing matchings.)</Par>
          <Par sx={{ my: 1 }}><FigureSingleTable query={`SELECT * FROM (${adjustedDepartments}) d LEFT JOIN employees e ON d.manager_id=e.e_id;`} tableScale={0.6} tableWidth={1100} /></Par>
        </>,
        <>
          <Par>In the <Term>right (outer) join</Term> we <Em>always</Em> keep the rows from the right table (employees). If no matching row exists from the left table (departments) then we include <ISQL>NULL</ISQL> values to show something is missing. (But rows from the left table will still disappear on missing matchings.)</Par>
          <Par sx={{ my: 1 }}><FigureSingleTable query={`SELECT * FROM (${adjustedDepartments}) d RIGHT JOIN employees e ON d.manager_id=e.e_id;`} tableScale={0.6} tableWidth={1100} /></Par>
        </>,
        <>
          <Par>In the <Term>full (outer) join</Term> we <Em>always</Em> keep the rows from <Em>both</Em> tables. If any row from either table is without a matching row from the other table, we include <ISQL>NULL</ISQL> values. This ensures data never disappears.</Par>
          <Par sx={{ my: 1 }}><FigureSingleTable query={`SELECT * FROM (${adjustedDepartments}) d FULL JOIN employees e ON d.manager_id=e.e_id;`} tableScale={0.6} tableWidth={1100} /></Par>
        </>,
      ]} />
      <Info>Note that the distinction of natural/non-natural join is completely separate from the distinction of inner/outer join. The first issue is about "Do we manually specify on which attributes to perform the join, or do we just pick equally named attributes?" The second issue is about "How do we handle entries without a matching reference?" When we talk about a "join" we usually refer to the the non-natural inner join, but you could very well apply a natural full outer join too.</Info>
