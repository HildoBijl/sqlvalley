      <Par>There are two ways to <Term>join relations</Term> within relational algebra. The more general method is through the <Term>Cartesian product</Term> <M>\times</M> followed by a filter. The Cartesian product sets up a huge relation containing all <Em>combinations</Em> of tuples from each of the given relations. The filter then takes all the pairs of tuples from this that match up: we specify the foreign keys must be equal.</Par>
      <FigureExampleRAQuery query={<>σ<sub>departments.manager_id = employees.e_id</sub>(departments ⨯ employees)</>} actualQuery="SELECT * FROM departments JOIN employees ON departments.manager_id = employees.e_id" tableWidth={1000} tableScale={0.55} below />
      <Par>Alternatively, in some cases, we can also use the <Term>natural join</Term> <M>\bowtie</M> as a short-cut. This operator internally takes the Cartesian product of two relations and directly filters them, requiring all <Em>equally-named attributes</Em> to be equal. It saves us from having to set up the filter ourselves.</Par>
      <Info>Sometimes the attributes don't directly have the proper names for the natural join to work. We can first use the <Term>rename operator</Term> <M>\rho</M> to adjust attribute names, allowing the natural join to work.</Info>
